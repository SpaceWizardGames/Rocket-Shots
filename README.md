# Rocket-Shots
A point A to point B rocket game.

In this project I am learning the basics of unity and C#. So far I have covered many concepts such as:
for/while loops, if statements, case statements, variables, classes, public and private methods, etc. 
and of course general best practices of refactoring and clean code.
